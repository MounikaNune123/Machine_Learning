##🧠 Credit Card Risk Prediction
*This project aims to predict credit card risk by classifying customers based on their likelihood of defaulting on payments. 
*Using machine learning classification algorithms, the model analyzes customer features such as credit score,
transaction patterns, and outstanding balances to identify high-risk individuals. 
*The goal is to assist financial institutions 
in making informed credit decisions, reducing loan defaults, and managing financial risk efficiently.
